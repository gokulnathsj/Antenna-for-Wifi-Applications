# Antenna-for-Wifi-Applications

This Project deals with designing of a rectangular patch antenna in HFSS which could be used as a wifi router. We made two antennas one with 2.4GHz and the other with 5GHz. We used inset-feed technique to match the impedance of the transmission line to the antenna. We also wrote a small program which may help us to find the required parameters for the design
